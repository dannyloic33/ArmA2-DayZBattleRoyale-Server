##DayZ Battle Royale Community Server Pack.

v0.9.6.3c


The DayZ Battle Royale Community Server Pack works differently to the official servers. There must be an admin logged in to lock and restart the server for every round and the community pack does not include our custom anti-hack or spectator tools. Apart from these differences, you are getting the full Battle Royale experience.

___________________________________________

    Admins can use the following commands via the in-game chat to lock and restart the server:

    #login YOURPASSWORD
    #lock
    #unlock
    #shutdown (used to restart the server)
    

    You can also use the various RCON clients to do this if you wish.


___________________________________________
###Installing:

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded DayZBR_CSP.v0.9.6.3c.zip file into the server Arma 2 OA directory.
2. Create a new database and call it 'battleroyale' and a DB user with username/pass set to 'dayz'
3. Run the BR_SQL.sql query on the 'battleroyale' database. (There will be errors, but you can ignore them)
4. edit the bat.
5. 
6. 

Files with settings available to change are:

You can change the min players default(10) in this file.

    @BattleRoyale\addons\dayz_server\server_starter\waitForPlayers.sqf  

If you have created your Database with the settings above, you should not have to change anything in these files.

    dayz_1.emita\HiveExt.ini
    dayz_1.isoladecapraia\HiveExt.ini
    dayz_1.fata\HiveExt.ini
    dayz_1.kulima\HiveExt.ini


You MUST set the name of the server in each one of these files.
You must also set your in-game admin password here.

    dayz_1.emita\config_1234.cfg
    dayz_1.isoladecapraia\config_1234.cfg
    dayz_1.fata\config_1234.cfg
    dayz_1.kulima\config_1234.cfg

After you have all this set up, run the BattleRoyale_Server_Start_Script.bat to start the server. 
This will also auto-restart the server when it is shutdown.

Enjoy.
